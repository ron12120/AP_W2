# Prime Number Counter and Generator

## Overview

This project consists of a prime number counter and generator implemented in C. The provided files include:
- `MyPrimeCounter.c`: The main program to count prime numbers.
- `generator.c`: A program to generate prime numbers.
- `Makefile`: A Makefile to compile the programs.

## Files

### MyPrimeCounter.c

This file contains the implementation of a program that counts prime numbers within a specified range. It uses a simple algorithm to check for primality and counts the number of prime numbers found.

### generator.c

This file contains the implementation of a program that generates prime numbers up to a specified limit. It outputs the prime numbers to the console.

### Makefile

This file contains the build instructions for the project. It includes targets to compile the `MyPrimeCounter.c` and `generator.c` programs, as well as clean up build artifacts.

## Usage

### Compilation

To compile the programs, run the following command in the project directory:

```sh
make
